#Full Stack Nanodegree Project 4

## Set-Up Instructions:
1.  Update the value of application in app.yaml to the app ID you have registered
 in the App Engine admin console and would like to use to host your instance of this sample.
1.  Run the app with the devserver using dev_appserver.py DIR, and ensure it's
 running by visiting the API Explorer - by default localhost:8080/_ah/api/explorer.
1.  (Optional) Generate your client library(ies) with the endpoints tool.
 Deploy your application.
 
 
##Game Description:
The game is called Rock Paper Scissors. This game is to be played between two players. To create a
game, you need to provide two registered user names and optionally provide the total number of rounds
you intend to play (by default only 1 round is played). The logic is simple, each player selects the 
weapons he/she wants to use in each round. Once both the players select weapons for every round, the 
winner is declared. The logic is a player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has 
chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors") but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); 
a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cut paper")

##Score Keeping:
Each game is played between two users. When the game starts the status of the game is incomplete and unknown. Once both the users, play all the rounds, winner is selected based on the logic of the game.
Wins and losses properties for each user are updated once the winner is selected. Winner of game gets 
wins+1 while loser of the game gets losses+1. Also the ranking is based on the win ratio that is number
of wins/ (number of wins + number of losses). If two users have the same win ratio, the user with lesser
number of losses is given priority.
